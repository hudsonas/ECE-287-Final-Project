# ECE-287-Final-Project

http://morse-code-learning-device.wikispaces.com/ //Link to the report


The DE2-115 FPGA board is being used as a hands-on educational tool, to allow the user to learn Morse Code

The challenge is to not only demonstrate the Morse Code sequence for a given character in a static manner, but to also output the relative signal duration,
all while giving the flexibility to choose between a comprehensive set of characters and numbers

- The user controls switches to input the desired alphabet character, single digit or select punctuation (period, comma or question mark) into the board
- The board responds with two forms of notification; red LEDs and green LEDs
- The red LEDs spell out the entire Morse Code Sequence for the input character
- The Green LEDs pulse the length of the character elements in Morse Code (differing length of dashes and/or dots in series in varying orientation)
- To aid in learning the user is allowed to either let the board continue to cycle the selected character, stop the sequence or change the character at any time
